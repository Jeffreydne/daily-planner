## Learning Points

During the making of this quiz I devloped this website based on a model suggested by the UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp. The basic HTML and CSS were privided for the 9AM to Noon portion of the calendar. I added to the HTML and CSS to further implement the site. I used JavaScript together with Day.js to provide the logic for setting up a functional calendar that manipulated the DOM to insert and retrieve tasks and appointments, all while keeping in mind best practices.

## Credits
 The excellent staff at UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack Bootcamp provided the beginings of the table of technology used in this README.md. The basic design and layout of the workday scheduler is provided by UC Berkeley Extension. Starter CSS and HTML is also provided to implement the 9AM to Noon appearance, without any functionality.
 To store scores using localStorage, I borrowed heavily from the web storage tutorial at freeCodeCamp.org, modifying as needed.
